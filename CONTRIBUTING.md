Thanks for your interest in Reminisce!

My intent for this skin is to help me actually look at all the digital photos I have stored.  It’s currently very basic, and while I want to keep that look to the part of the skin you see all the time, I’m open to adding more buttons or a settings UI (so people don’t need to edit the ini file).

See the [issues](https://github.com/misterhaan/Reminisce/issues) if you’d like to help out but don’t know what to do, or add your own bug reports or suggestions.  You can mostly expect pull requests to be merged if they close an issue, especially if I opened the issue or have commented on it.

If you’re adding an image, please include the GIMP xcf file (or equivalent) in addition to the final png.  Generally, images should be some variation of [Material Design](https://material.io/icons/) icons.
